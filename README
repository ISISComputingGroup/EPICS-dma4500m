### What is this repository for? ###
This repository contains the basic source for an Anton Paar DMA 4500 M density
meter EPICS IOC. It is very basic and allows only setting temperature, starting
measurement and reading out densty and temperature once measurement is finished.
It has no error handling and there are no doubt bugs. It needs major
improvements before being used in a production environment.

The startup script assumes the DMA4500M is connected via a Moxa
ethernet-to-RS-232 converter or equivalent.

OPI (CSS-Studio) file is included
